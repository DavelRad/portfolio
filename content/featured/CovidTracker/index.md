This project involved building an HTTP server from scratch using the C programming language to deepen our understanding of web technologies and network programming. By employing TCP for reliable data transmission and focusing on the HTTP 0.9 protocol, our server efficiently handles multiple concurrent requests through multi-threading with pthread.h and socket programming with sys/socket.h. This hands-on experience not only enhanced our skills in managing server-client communications but also provided practical insights into the foundational technologies that power the internet.
