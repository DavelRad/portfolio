Capturing first place at a [Leaner Startup's Hackathon](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davelradindra_congrats-congratulations-ai-activity-7067640610014302208-PoRz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), our team dynamically created "Scam Detect," a pivotal full-stack web application crafted to protect the elderly and minorities from tech scams. By integrating Python in the backend and the responsive Panel framework for the frontend, we engineered the application to transcribe and analyze call audios. It actively evaluates the content using a specially trained OpenAI model, calculating and displaying the likelihood of scams in real-time percentages, thus empowering users to recognize and avoid fraudulent interactions effectively.
