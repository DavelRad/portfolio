Our Java-based media player project aimed to simplify and enhance multimedia consumption on multiple operating systems including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The team utilized JavaFX to build a user-friendly interface through FXML and Scene Builder, ensuring the application was accessible and functional for a wide range of users. Key features of the media player include intuitive media controls, real-time subtitle synchronization, and customizable playback options. Throughout the project, we focused on integrating advanced user functionalities while maintaining ease of use. The collaborative effort resulted in a robust application, demonstrated effectively in our comprehensive YouTube presentation.
